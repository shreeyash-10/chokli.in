# Bad Stats Playbook (Savage Edition)

This is a quick guide for demolishing weak cricket stats without attacking people.

## Red flags (instant fail)
- No source, no match list.
- Mixed formats in one claim.
- Tiny sample size sold as a trend.
- No opponent tier, venue, or conditions.
- Percentages with no denominator.
- Arbitrary time windows that hide better data.

## Common trash-stat patterns and clean counters

1) "Player X averages Y in chases"
Why it is weak:
- No target size, required run rate, or wickets context.
Counter:
- Compare same target bands and RRR bands with win/loss splits.

2) "Player X is slow because strike rate is Z"
Why it is weak:
- Ignores role and match phase.
Counter:
- Split by powerplay, middle, death; compare team run rate at the crease.

3) "Most runs since year N"
Why it is weak:
- Cherry-picked start date.
Counter:
- Use full era windows or rolling 3-year samples.

4) "Best average in wins"
Why it is weak:
- Selection bias. Wins already imply team success.
Counter:
- Compare wins vs losses and team average in the same matches.

5) "Fails in big games"
Why it is weak:
- "Big game" is undefined.
Counter:
- Define stage, opponent tier, and pressure bands.

6) "Not good outside home"
Why it is weak:
- No venue difficulty normalization.
Counter:
- Compare to peers at same venues and in the same era.

7) "No match-winning innings"
Why it is weak:
- Impact is not only one huge score.
Counter:
- Use win probability added or runs above par for the situation.

8) "Low average in last 10 games"
Why it is weak:
- Sample is too small.
Counter:
- Use a longer window with variance and confidence notes.

## Response skeleton
- Verdict: blunt and short.
- Missing context: 3-5 bullets.
- Corrected framing: what a fair comparison needs.
- Takeaway: one line.
